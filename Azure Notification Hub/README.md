Due to the nature of Notification Hub, information on this topic will be relatively limited. This is because it is much more difficult to demonstrate, compared to other Azure services, as it requires a fully working app to utilise. Note that this topic will be very short, and instructions on creating a Notification Hub will be omitted as it is very simple to create, but linking is more difficult but I am unable to test, and therefore verify, if my instructions would work correctly.  
For an example on how to deploy a Notification hub, see [here (Legacy Android)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-android-push-notification-google-fcm-get-started) or [here (Current android).](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/notification-hubs/android-sdk)
