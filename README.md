What the Azure Free Tier entitles you to

Key documentation and where to find it

# Disclaimer
All topics covered in this module are my own knowledge, and may not be the most up to date information. Azure is being updated all the time (Thousands of times a day!) and it is impossible to always be right. If you are unsure of something, always research further before going ahead. I am not responsible if you accidentally deploy a VM which is $30,000 a month!
# Skills required

While not required, having completed the Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900), AWS Cloud Practioner or equivalent will be helpful, as there will only be a brief recap for some topics already covered in these exams.  
I highly recommend having an Azure Free Tier account, or if you have access to A Cloud Guru, utilising their Cloud Playground.  
A Cloud Guru: [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com/)  
Azure sign-up (Credit card required): [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/)
